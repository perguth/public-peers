# Public Peers

This repository contains peering information for publicly accessible nodes on
the Yggdrasil network. 

Note that not all peers in this repository are guaranteed to be online - check
the [Public Peers](https://publicpeers.neilalexander.dev/) page instead to find
peers that are online now.

In most cases, public peers should be accessible by adding the string provided
for each peer to the `Peers: []` section of your `yggdrasil.conf` configuration
file.

Example in `yggdrasil.conf`:
```
Peers:
[
  tcp://a.b.c.d:e
  tcp://d.c.b.a:e
  tcp://[a:b:c::d]:e
  tcp://[d:c:b::a]:e
]
```

### How do I pick peers?

If you are new to the network then take a look at the [Public Peers](https://publicpeers.neilalexander.dev/)
page to find public peers that are online.

Always try to pick peers that are as close to you geographically as possible, as
this will keep the latency of the network down.

If you are using a home connection then you should avoid peering with any nodes
that are far away, as you may end up carrying traffic for the rest of the
network.

For normal usage, you probably only need 2 or 3 peers.

#### Peer selection/management tools

- [Yggrasil network peers checker / updater](https://github.com/ygguser/peers_updater) \
  The utility is designed to check the availability of peers and automatically update them in the Yggdrasil configuration file, as well as using the admin API - addPeer method.



### TLS peers

As of Yggdrasil v0.3.11, peering connections over TLS are now possible. This hides
the peering connection inside a regular TLS session, which can help in some cases
where firewalls or deep packet inspection may identify or block regular Yggdrasil
peering traffic.

TLS public peers are identified by the prefix `tls://` instead of `tcp://`. 

Note that, due to the additional layer of encryption, performance via TLS peers
may be slightly worse than via regular `tcp://` peers.
